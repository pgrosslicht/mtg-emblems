Magic Emblems
=============

If you are searching for a way to spice up your old boring Magic: The Gathering game, then look no further. 
Magic Emblems is quick and easy way to add excitement, fun and a lot of tide turning to every game you play.

If you want to compile it, `cd` to your `javascript` directory and execute the following command. Make sure you have [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) installed.
```bash
coffee --compile emblems_list.coffee
coffee --compile emblems.coffee
```
If you can't or don't want to compile it, then you can use the precompiled version [here](https://pdgwien.github.io/mtg-embleme/)

How to Play
===========
If you play with a local group, one of you opens Magic Emblems on his phone. Then you request an emblem every turn, discarding the effects of the older emblems (unless it is stated differently) and have fun!
